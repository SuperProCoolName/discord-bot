# Description
I made this bot in January and was too lazy to continue working on it. It's better to work on discord bots with JavaScript.

# Usage
On line 54 you can change the channel id:
```python
channel = bot.get_channel(896077052250296360)
```
Change `896077052250296360` to your needed ID.

Also, make sure to create new .env file and make new variable "DISCORD_TOKEN" like this:
```python
DISCORD_TOKEN = your_token
```
